- converter.py: the original converter script, basically defunct now but a good reference
- converterNode.py: the new and improved converter script, utilizes a Node class and digests CSV's

To run the CSV through the converter you just need to run the conversion script in the terminal and make sure the CSV is in the same folder. The name for the CSV file is hardcoded in the code to be recognized as 'benData.csv' so either make sure the file has that name or the code (line 27) needs to be edited to fit the input style of your choice.
