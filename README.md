# WeightedImageTidyTree

BenTreeConverter: this is the folder containing files related to converting your excel file to the JSON file that is ingested by the D3

BenTree Legacy: this is the first iteration of the tree. the code is honestly ancient and inefficient but it is useful as a reference

PanTidy: this is the culmination of my work. just two files and very easy to get up and running

WorkingTidy: this code works but is missing the bells and whistles of PanTidy and is also less efficient
